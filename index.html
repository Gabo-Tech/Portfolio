        <h2>üìú About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Full Stack Engineer with over two years of experience in
          developing web applications that help people achieve their wellness,
          fitness, and weight loss goals. I work at Beyondbmi, a platform that
          offers personalized and data-driven solutions for users and coaches. I
          also run GABO, a company that helps small businesses develop their
          products.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use various technologies, frameworks, and best practices, such as
          MERN Stack, Svelte, Angular, TypeScript, Clean Code, and DevOps, to
          design, develop, test, and deploy features and functionalities that
          enhance the user experience and the performance of the platform. I
          collaborate with other developers, designers, and stakeholders to
          ensure the quality and consistency of the code and the product. I am
          passionate about creating innovative, user-friendly, and scalable
          solutions that solve real-world problems and facilitate people's
          lives. I am always eager to learn new skills, improve my knowledge,
          and share my insights with others. You can see some of my projects on

          Full Stack Engineer
          <br />
          Nov 2022 - Present
          <br />
          Dublin, Ireland
          <br />
          <br />
          As a Full-Stack Software Engineer with a specialization in JavaScript,
          I have been responsible for developing a comprehensive online weight
          loss clinic platform. This project entailed utilizing Angular and
          Bootstrap for the front-end design, while the back-end infrastructure
          was built on Express and TypeORM, employing TypeScript across both
          ends for consistency and reliability. In adherence to stringent
          medical privacy laws such as HIPAA, the platform incorporates robust
          encryption protocols to ensure the security and confidentiality of
          patient data.
          <br />
          <br />
          Additionally, I expanded the platform's reach by developing an
          accompanying Android application using React Native and Metro, further
          enhancing the user experience on mobile devices. My responsibilities
          also extended to the deployment and development of AWS Lambda
          functions, integrating AWS Cognito for secure authentication
          processes. This multifaceted role demanded a deep understanding of
          both front-end and back-end development, a strong commitment to data
          privacy, and the ability to implement scalable solutions in a cloud
          environment.
